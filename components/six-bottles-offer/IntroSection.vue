        Hey, Jessica here!<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        Okay, so you didn’t take me up on the year-supply of FlameLean.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        Maybe you don’t have the money to afford 12 bottles right now…<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        Or, maybe you’re unsure whether it will actually work for you.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        All of those are valid thoughts and feelings…<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        In fact, I used to think that way too.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        That is until I started taking FlameLean every day…<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        And witnessed how mine and so many other women’s bodies have dramatically<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        transformed because of it.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        That’s why I’d hate for you to miss out…<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        Especially if a lack of money is stopping you right now.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        That’s why I’m going to offer you half a year’s supply of FlameLean at a larger<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        discount than I could offer before.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        On the last page, I offered you 6 bottles for $234…<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        Which was already a whopping $120 saving.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        But I’m going to do something crazy right now.<br class="d-none d-sm-flex"/>
        Right here, right now, what I’m offering you is…
