          I’m 35 years old and have suffered from Type 2 diabetes
          for the last 9 years.
          It crept up on me out of nowhere.
          And as soon as it did, so did the 40 pounds of weight gain…
          In as little as 6 months!
          When I was a teenager, I was so skinny my friends used to
          tease me for being a stick figure.
          My nickname was “Twiggy.”
          But, that all changed once I got into my late twenties.
          Out of nowhere, I started feeling extremely tired.
          Like all the time.
          Which was making it super hard for me to concentrate at work.
          I couldn’t even go an hour without needing to pee.
          Plus, I was always so thirsty no matter how many liters of water
          I was drinking…
          Which made me need to pee even more!
          It was a vicious cycle.
          One that made sense once my doctor gave me the diabetes
          diagnosis.
          And ever since, I’ve been on different medications…
          Trying and failing to eat healthily and exercise consistently…
          Injecting myself with insulin shots that have bruised and
          scarred my body…
          And trying holistic “woo woo” treatments to get my blood sugar
          in check and burn stubborn fat.
          But nothing was working as effortlessly or as quickly as I’d
          have liked. That is…
