Thank you for your reply.

Are you able to confirm that celebrities have used this specific product for their weight loss? If not the claims regarding celebrities will need to be removed.

A doctor recommended claim, doctor approved claim, and doctor supported claim carries a lot of weight with consumers. Thus, it typically requires a well-conducted, random, and statistically significant survey of doctors in the relevant practice area showing that a substantial percentage recommend the product. The fact that the product is recommended by one or even a handful of doctors is not enough.

Please remove these claims if you are unable to provide substantiation of the survey.

Per the FDA, dietary supplements and food products may carry claims that describe the effect of a substance in maintaining the body's normal structure or function. By law dietary supplements cannot imply the product diagnoses, treats, cures, or prevents a disease.

Please edit the following statements:

"Celebrities are now getting these diabetes medications easily prescribed to them?
Paying a hefty $1,300 fee every single month.

It costs as much as many mortgages! Because of that, most insurance companies won?t cover it for regular folk like you and me.
And while the price might be eye watering to us? It?s a drop in the ocean for the rich and famous.
Meaning they can easily achieve rapid weight loss and keep it off?
So long as they continue injecting themselves with the medication." This section will need to be removed or completely re-written. You may not reference diabetes in your marketing in any way. You may only discuss supporting already healthy blood sugar levels.

A product has to be all or virtually all made in the United States for it to be advertised or labeled as "Made in the USA."

Unless you can confirm all or mostly all ingredients are in fact sourced from the USA, then any "Made in the USA" claim must be qualified with the following verbiage:

"Manufactured in the USA from the finest of foreign and domestic ingredients."

Can you confirm that the urgency statement below is true?

"Limited Time:
Claim your discounted Flamelean
while stocks last "

If not, please remove this and any similar statements from the Pitch Page.

The FTC considers false urgency claims to be "digital dark patterns" and strongly discourages sellers from using this type of messaging. Digital dark patterns are practices that trick, manipulate, or pressure customers into making choices. Some examples of what the FTC deems dark patterns:

URGENCY - baseless countdown timer, false limited time messaging, false discount claims
SCARCITY - false low stock messaging, false high demand messaging, false activity messaging

Under Federal law, dietary supplements can't be promoted as "safe" or "free from side-effects". Dietary supplements aren't always safe or harmless. Even "natural" supplements can be risky for people on certain medicines or with certain medical conditions because they aren't proven to be safe and effective.

It is also recommended that consumers check with a medical professional before including any dietary supplement into their diet routine, especially when taking other medications. However, most consumers don't do this. There is a possibility that a consumer will ingest your supplement and have an adverse event, this is a risk the consumer takes. Stating that the product is "safe" or "free from side-effects" is misleading to the consumer.

Customers must be able to reach you if they have a question about your product or if they need technical assistance after the purchase. This ensures optimal customer service and reduces refunds and chargeback rates. Please include an email address, a link to your email address, a contact us link, or a link to a customer support ticket system on your Thank You Page.

Please let me know when the requested changes have been made by commenting on this ticket.
